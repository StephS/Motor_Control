This board is an H-Bridge DC Motor Controller. The ratings are yet to be determined (requires calculation).
The end goal is to support a 12v 60A Electric Trolling Motor for a boat. This board does NOT have a PWM source (that will be a separate board).
Licence is CC-BY-SA

This board is a PROTOTYPE until the design is built and tested.

The bottom traces need Solid wire soldered on to improve current capacity. Please read the Allegro A3941 Datasheet for usage.
